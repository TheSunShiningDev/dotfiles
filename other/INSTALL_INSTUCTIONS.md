# INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

I know some of my doc files have install instructions, but I didn't want to create a file for every tool.

So that is what this file is for!

It contains the install instructions for some of my favorite tools!


**Docs that contain install instructions:**
- [brew.md](brew.md)
- [../rootDOCS/config_kitty.md]
