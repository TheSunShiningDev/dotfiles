# INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS


I know some of my doc files have install instructions, but I didn't want to create a file for every tool.

So that is what this file is for!

It contains the install instructions for some of my favorite tools!


**Docs that contain install instructions:**
- [brew.md](brew.md)
- [python](python.md) - install from download, and not with brew
- [node.j][Node.md]
- [rootDOCS/config_kitty.md](../rootDOCS/config_kitty.md)
- [rootDOCS/config_nvim.md](../rootDOCS/config_nvim.md)
- [rootDOCS/gitconfig.md](../rootDOCS/gitconfig.md)
- [rootDOCS/oh-my-zsh.md](../rootDOCS/oh-my-zsh.md)
- [rootDOCS/vimrc.md](../rootDOCS/vimrc.md)
- [rootDOCS/zshrc.md](../rootDOCS/zshrc.md)
