# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles

**Oct 29, 2024**

Hi.

I decided if I am going to do this.
I am going to do it my way.


So what am I doing and how am I doing it?

I am documenting my dotfiles/configuration files. And I am syncing them to this repo via terminal commands, see my sh folder. (I am laughing at the fact that I create .sh bash files and use zsh to run them!)

This is a learning journey for me.
And I will be saving things here as I am satsified with them.
So far I am only satified with my zsh configuration.
