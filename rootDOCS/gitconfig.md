**install**
I think usully comes when I install xcode on mac os, or vs code?
- ```brew install git``` ?? I haven't used brew to install

### .gitconfig

this is what mine looks like.
```sh
[user]
	email = thesunshiningmin@gmail.com
	name = The SunShining
```

git configuration is really easy and it usually done from terminal with
```sh
git config --global user.name "The SunShining"
git config --global user.email thesunshiningmin@gmail.com
```
