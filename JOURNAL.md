**Oct 29, 2024 - Afternoon**

I decided to be lazy with my nvim setup.

https://www.lazyvim.org/

Will update later when I customize more!


**Oct 30, 2024**

- Added my kitty config!
- added more notes to some things.
- added my vim configuration notes.

As a user getting started with vim, their is the desire to have it work for everything. I love the fact that I have a few options. And one of those options is to customize and use vim differently from neovim.


The last few days it has been fun to learn and configure, and watch how my configurations evolve.
But other than that, I haven't really been doing anything the last few days.

My learning has made me more comfortable in the terminal and with dotfiles. Now I feel like I am documenting too much. Because I can have comments and notes in the actual files!

Morning - 6:00 AM

Documenting my setup at definitely helped me learn more.
I went from not using the terminal, or vim much to now using neovim to edit this doc!!!
I am looking forward to learning more today and setting up more.

I am liking my lazy setup for neovim. And I am thinking of going with no plugins for vim.
And maybe I will set up another text editor today, so I have more options!

Morning - 6:49 AM

not sure what I will get to today, but here are some bullet points of some things i want to look at. will come back and cross them off when I get to them
- ~~lazygit?~~
- more documentation
- Add tmux, learn this
- Create an install .sh file for installing certain things. (probably a future project)
- Nano?
- maybe find a file browser for the terminal
- ~~charm & glow!!~~ - some cool tools, but don't think I need them.

one of the fun thing about any project is that it is never really will be complete, and this project is a fun one, because it is my learning journey with some of these tools.
and one can never stop learning.
