I decided to be lazy with my nvim setup.

Will update later when I customize more!


**Oct 30, 2024**

- Added my kitty config!
- added more notes to some things.
- added my vim configuration notes.

As a user getting started with vim, their is the desire to have it work for everything. I love the fact that I have a few options. And one of those options is to customize and use vim differently from neovim.


The last few days it has been fun to learn and configure, and watch how my configurations evolve.
But other than that, I haven't really been doing anything the last few days.

My learning has made me more comfortable in the terminal and with dotfiles. Now I feel like I am documenting too much. Because I can have comments and notes in the actual files!
