I decided to be lazy with my nvim setup.

Will update later when I customize more!

- Added my kitty config!
- added more notes to some things.
- added my vim configuartion notes.

As a user getting started with vim, their is the desire to have it work for everything. I love the fact that I have a few options. And one of those options is to customize and use vim differently from neovim.
